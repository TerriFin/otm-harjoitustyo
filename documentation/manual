***Ekonomista manual***

**Updated for release "Week6 realease"**

To download the game, all you need to do is download the four following file;

*companies.data*

*Ekonomista.jar*

*EkonomistaTheme.mp4*

*HiScores.sb*

Once you have all these downloaded, just put them all in the same folder and double click on *"Ekonomista.jar"*.

Alternatively, .jar files can also be started with the following console command;

**java -jar Ekonomista.jar**

***After launching the game***

You will be presented with the main menu. Here you can navigate into hiscores, or company creator.

If you downloaded companies.data, you have some companies bu default so you can just insert name and hit *start*.

**Company creator**

In company creator you can create new companies just by filling the blank inputs.

Perhaps the two most confusing fields are the last two. They basically mean the amount company index can change in one tick, and how much it can change in total in one tick.

**High scores**

Here be high scores

Nothing else

**Game view**

Here you can buy and sell stocks. Keep track of what is going up and what is going down and try to earn money.

There is also big *"Retire"*-button below your name. Pressing this and confirming closes the game and submits current score into highscores. Be sure to sell all stocks before pressing this thought!



*That is about all. Have fun!*
